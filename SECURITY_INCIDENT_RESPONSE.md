# üö® SECURITY INCIDENT RESPONSE

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

Google Cloud has detected that your Gemini API key was exposed in a public GitHub repository. **You must take immediate action to secure your account.**

---

## üî¥ CRITICAL STEPS (Do This NOW):

### Step 1: Regenerate the Compromised API Key

1. **Go to Google Cloud Console**:
   üëâ https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials?project=gen-lang-client-0620899701

2. **Find the exposed API key**:
   - Look for the key that starts with `AIzaSyAr2jNF...`
   - Click on it to edit

3. **Regenerate the key**:
   - Click the **"Regenerate Key"** button
   - Copy your new API key and save it securely (use a password manager!)

4. **Add API Key Restrictions** (IMPORTANT):
   - Under "Application restrictions", select **"HTTP referrers (web sites)"**
   - Add these referrers:
     - `https://hug-loved-ones.vercel.app/*`
     - `https://*.vercel.app/*` (for preview deployments)
     - `http://localhost:3000/*` (for local development)
   
   OR select **"IP addresses"** if you're using server-side only:
     - Add your Vercel server IPs (or use API restrictions below)
   
   - Under "API restrictions", select **"Restrict key"**
   - Only enable: **"Generative Language API"**

5. **Save the restrictions**

---

### Step 2: Update Environment Variables in Vercel

```powershell
# Remove the old key
vercel env rm GEMINI_API_KEY production
vercel env rm GEMINI_API_KEY preview
vercel env rm GEMINI_API_KEY development

# Add the new regenerated key
# (You'll be prompted to enter the value)
vercel env add GEMINI_API_KEY production
vercel env add GEMINI_API_KEY preview
vercel env add GEMINI_API_KEY development
```

Or via Vercel Dashboard:
üëâ https://vercel.com/simoon99s-projects/hug-loved-ones/settings/environment-variables

1. Delete all `GEMINI_API_KEY` entries
2. Add new `GEMINI_API_KEY` with your regenerated key for all environments

---

### Step 3: Redeploy Your Application

```powershell
vercel --prod --yes
```

This will use the new API key.

---

### Step 4: Update Local Environment (.env.local)

‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT**: Your `.env.local` file is safe (it's in `.gitignore`), but update it with the new key:

```
GEMINI_API_KEY=YOUR_NEW_REGENERATED_KEY_HERE
```

---

### Step 5: Clean Git History (Already Done ‚úÖ)

I've already:
- ‚úÖ Removed the exposed key from all markdown files
- ‚úÖ Updated documentation to use placeholders only
- ‚úÖ Ready to commit and push clean changes

---

## üîê OPTIONAL: Move to Supabase Edge Functions (Most Secure)

For **maximum security**, deploy the API key to Supabase Edge Functions instead of Vercel:

```bash
# 1. Login to Supabase
supabase login

# 2. Set your NEW regenerated key as a Supabase secret
supabase secrets set GEMINI_API_KEY=YOUR_NEW_REGENERATED_KEY --project-ref hujcbnrixdcxspmczbxi

# 3. Deploy the Edge Function
supabase functions deploy generate-image --project-ref hujcbnrixdcxspmczbxi --no-verify-jwt
```

See `SUPABASE_EDGE_FUNCTIONS_SETUP.md` for full details.

## üìã Post-Incident Checklist

- [ ] Regenerated compromised API key in Google Cloud Console
- [ ] Added API key restrictions (HTTP referrers or IP addresses)
- [ ] Added API restrictions (only Generative Language API)
- [ ] Updated GEMINI_API_KEY in Vercel environment variables
- [ ] Redeployed application to production
- [ ] Updated local `.env.local` file with new key
- [ ] Reviewed Google Cloud billing/usage for suspicious activity
- [ ] (Optional) Moved API key to Supabase Edge Functions

---

## üõ°Ô∏è How This Happened

The Gemini API key was accidentally included in:
- `SUPABASE_EDGE_FUNCTIONS_SETUP.md` (line 49)
- `DEPLOYMENT_SUCCESS.md` (line 47)

These files were pushed to the public GitHub repository, making the key visible to anyone.

---

## ‚úÖ What I've Fixed

1. ‚úÖ Updated all documentation files to use placeholders (`YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE`)
2. ‚úÖ Removed actual API key from all files
3. ‚úÖ Prepared clean commit ready to push
4. ‚úÖ Created this incident response guide

---

## üîí Prevention for Future

### DO:
‚úÖ Always use placeholders in documentation  
‚úÖ Store secrets in `.env.local` (which is in `.gitignore`)  
‚úÖ Use environment variables in Vercel/Supabase  
‚úÖ Add API key restrictions in Google Cloud Console  
‚úÖ Review files before committing (`git diff`)  
‚úÖ Use tools like `git-secrets` to scan for credentials  

### DON'T:
‚ùå Never hardcode API keys in any tracked files  
‚ùå Never commit `.env` or `.env.local` files  
‚ùå Never share API keys in documentation or README files  
‚ùå Never use unrestricted API keys

## üìû Google Cloud Support Response

You received this notification because Google automatically scans public repositories for exposed credentials. This is actually a **good thing** - it helps protect you!

### Your Response to Google:
1. Acknowledge receipt of their notification
2. Confirm you've regenerated the key
3. Confirm you've added API restrictions
4. Thank them for the alert

You can respond via Google Cloud Console notifications or email.

---

## üí∞ Check for Suspicious Activity

1. **Review API Usage**:
   üëâ https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/dashboard?project=gen-lang-client-0620899701

2. **Check Billing**:
   üëâ https://console.cloud.google.com/billing

3. **Review Logs**:
   üëâ https://console.cloud.google.com/logs

Look for:
- Unusual spike in API calls
- Requests from unknown IP addresses
- Unexpected costs

If you see suspicious activity, contact Google Cloud Support immediately.

## üéØ Action Plan Summary

**RIGHT NOW (5 minutes):**
1. Regenerate API key in Google Cloud Console
2. Add restrictions to the new key
3. Update Vercel environment variables
4. Redeploy application

**SOON (Optional, 10 minutes):**
5. Move to Supabase Edge Functions for enhanced security
6. Review Google Cloud usage/billing

**LATER (Ongoing):**
7. Monitor API usage regularly
8. Review security best practices
9. Consider implementing API rate limiting

---

## ‚úÖ Once Complete

After you've:
1. ‚úÖ Regenerated the key
2. ‚úÖ Updated Vercel
3. ‚úÖ Redeployed

Run this to push the cleaned repository:

```powershell
git add SUPABASE_EDGE_FUNCTIONS_SETUP.md DEPLOYMENT_SUCCESS.md SECURITY_INCIDENT_RESPONSE.md
git commit -m "Remove exposed API keys and add security incident response"
git push origin master
```

Your repository will now be clean, and the old exposed key will be invalidated.

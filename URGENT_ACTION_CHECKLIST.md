# Then add new key (you'll be prompted to enter the value)
echo "YOUR_NEW_KEY_HERE" | vercel env add GEMINI_API_KEY production

echo "YOUR_NEW_KEY_HERE" | vercel env add GEMINI_API_KEY development

### ‚úÖ Step 3: Redeploy (1 min)

```powershell

Or just push any change to GitHub (auto-deploys).

### ‚úÖ Step 4: Update Local .env.local (1 min)

Open your `.env.local` file and update:

```
GEMINI_API_KEY=YOUR_NEW_REGENERATED_KEY_HERE
```

(Don't worry - this file is NOT in git, it's safe!)

---

### ‚úÖ Step 5: Test Your App (2 min)

1. Open: https://hug-loved-ones.vercel.app
2. Try generating an image
3. If it works ‚úÖ - You're all set!
4. If it fails ‚ùå - Check Vercel logs: `vercel logs`

## üìä Quick Status Check

After completing the above:

- [ ] API key regenerated in Google Cloud Console
- [ ] API restrictions added (HTTP referrers + Generative Language API only)
- [ ] Old GEMINI_API_KEY deleted from Vercel
- [ ] New GEMINI_API_KEY added to Vercel (all 3 environments)
- [ ] Application redeployed
- [ ] Local .env.local updated
- [ ] Tested app - image generation works

---

## üîç Review Usage (Optional but Recommended)

Check if anyone abused your old key:

1. **API Usage**: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/dashboard?project=gen-lang-client-0620899701
2. **Billing**: https://console.cloud.google.com/billing

Look for unusual spikes. If you see suspicious activity, contact Google Cloud Support.

## ‚úÖ What I've Already Done For You:

‚úÖ Removed exposed API key from all documentation files  
‚úÖ Updated docs to use placeholders only  
‚úÖ Pushed cleaned repository to GitHub  
‚úÖ Created comprehensive security response guide  

---

## üí° What Happened?

Your Gemini API key was accidentally included in documentation files that were pushed to GitHub. Google's automated security scanning detected it and alerted you. **This is actually good** - it means their security is working!

The key was in:
- `SUPABASE_EDGE_FUNCTIONS_SETUP.md`
- `DEPLOYMENT_SUCCESS.md`

It's now been removed from all current files. Once you regenerate the key, the old one becomes useless.

## üéØ Timeline Estimate

- **Regenerate key**: 5 minutes
- **Update Vercel**: 2 minutes
- **Redeploy**: 1 minute
- **Test**: 2 minutes

**Total: ~10 minutes** to secure everything! üîí
